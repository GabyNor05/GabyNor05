## [Tutor Aid](https://github.com/GabyNor05/TutorAid) (Semester 2)

[![Tutor Aid](./assets/tutorAidHeader.png)](https://github.com/GabyNor05/TutorAid)

Tutor Aid is a platform designed to connect students with reliable and relatable tutors who understand their learning journey. The platform focuses on simplicity, trust, and efficiency, allowing students to easily find support, book sessions, and grow academically.

As a tutor myself, I saw how difficult it can be to manage timetables, communicate with students, and present yourself professionally online. Tutor Aid is built to make that entire process smoother, supportive, and human.

The goal is to empower tutors to share knowledge confidently, while helping students receive consistent, meaningful academic support.
